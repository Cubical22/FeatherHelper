# FeatherHelper
Ever needed some custom entities and decals to use for feather gameplay in celeste?
well, you are in luck, cause I'm exactly working on that (wip)

so far, we have:
- Feather Barrier: only let's the player through if not in feather state
- Feather Filter: only let's the player through if they are in feather state
- Connections: entities used for making maps. only for decoration
